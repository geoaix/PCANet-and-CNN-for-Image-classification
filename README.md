# PCANet-and-CNN-for-Image-classification

In this paper, we reimplement the PCANet proposed by "Pcanet: A simple deep learning baseline
for image classification?,‚Äù IEEE Transactions on Image Processing," in torch7. We test
the PCANet in CIFAR10 dataset for objection recognition task. We also test a
variety of CNNs on these tasks to compare the performances. We find that the
CNN outperform PCANet in terms of test accuracy and training time.
